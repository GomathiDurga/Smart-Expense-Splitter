# 💸 Smart Expense Splitter

A tiny Python + Flask web app that **fairly splits discounted group orders** (Instamart, JioMart, Swiggy, etc.) between friends based on what each person originally ordered.

## Features
- Enter number of friends, final bill after discount, and each friend’s original cart amount.  
- Calculates each person’s **exact fair share** and a **rounded rupee amount**.  
- Rounded amounts still add up exactly to the final bill.  
- Clean, responsive UI that works on mobile and desktop.
